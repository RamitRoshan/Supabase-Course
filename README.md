- Supabase is an alternative to Firebase & it's a great alternative to Firebase. It is known as a Backend as a Service , meaning that we actually don't have to build our own backend . Supabase will help develop everything for you. and Introduce you different methods and functions that you can call in your frontend  to actually execute functionality that we would normally have to serve through an endpoint that you build on your backend .
